I am due to begin a new role as a highschool teacher in a few weeks time.

This will be my first ever time formally teaching in a secondary school. Prior to this all experience I had was just training as part of my Teaching Qualification programme, first at Lynfield College and then at Auckland Grammar School.

I'm really looking forward to teaching. While I am nervous about getting started I feel as though I have a lot to give and make. Over the next few weeks I intend on preparing myself as much as I can, as well as generating teaching resources that myself and others can use.

I'm excited to share what is to come with you all.
