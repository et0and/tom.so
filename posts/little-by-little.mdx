title: Little by little
summary: Trying to be a bit easier on myself.

The period of time in between each blog post I publish seems to get longer and longer with each passing month.

There's been a lot of trial and error this year. I've had the time to work on my own projects, but haven't been able to keep consistent and finish much of what I start. There is a constant feeling of having to juggle things, that I cannot afford to spend an extended amount of time working away on something for the sole benefit of myself.

I'm in a bit of a rut creatively. I have plenty to keep myself occupied at work, but in my own life things have been quite flat. I'd tried to force myself out of this and "break the wall" by putting out things like a series of experimental websites, as well as publishing a few short "music videos" on Instagram. But none of these things have really felt all that fun for me in the end, and a few of the works themselves don't feel authentic. It was a kind of putting things out there, screaming against the sky type of feeling, and waiting for any response or feeling back.&#x20;
