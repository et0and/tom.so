At 4pm this afternoon the prime minister of Aotearoa announced that the country was going to be moving into Level 2. For the past month I’ve been staying indoors like many others, and have really enjoyed the stillness.

I am a bit scared about how the next few weeks will be. With everything that has happened my perception of being out in the public and dealing with strangers has completely changed. It’s made me realise just how much I enjoy and appreciate being in my own space, and that this doesn’t mean you have to be completely disconnected either.
