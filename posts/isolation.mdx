Spending this week in isolation due to being classified as a household contact.

It has been a strange time. On the one hand it has been peaceful being able to work from home and avoid the mad rush of teaching physically. On the other hand, things that would normally take a single step (or no steps at all) are now three, and you find youself having to constantly work around issues rather than being able to really solve them.

Seeing your loved ones get Covid is also not fun at all. Not being able to do anything about it is even worse.

Here's to hoping that next week goes better.
