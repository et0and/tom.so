The lockdown has meant that I've been able to dig deeper into the discography of a few artists lately.

One artist in particular that I've been listening to a lot is JPEGMAFIA. I've been a big listener of his for the past few years and his last album _All My Heroes Are Cornballs_ was my AOTY last year. His level of production is truly off the wall, like a scratched Playstation One disc that's been uploaded via Tor and spat out the other side. His use of a Ridge Racer 4 sample in BALD! is one such example, and results in songs that are like nothing else ever done before in my opinion.

I don't think his comparison to Death Grips is fair. While I understand that his earlier work had production that sounds somewhat like a Death Grips record (the song Baby I'm Bleeding is a good example), JPEGMAFIA's lyrics are highly political, full of clever wordplay and excellent delivery. You get the impression that this is a person who truly cares about his craft, but doesn't give a damn at the same time. He is genuinely doing it for the music and is making it how he wants - just looking at some of his song titles is a testament to this.

Personally I find his music and artistry incredibly refreshing and inspiring. I think this kind of mindset translates into all arenas of life, and it gives me a renewed sense of motivation towards my own ongoing projects.
