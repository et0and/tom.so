Many big developments as of late.

Sophie and I have moved into our new place. This is the first time I've ever felt that there's been a space that has been truly ours and a result of what we've worked for.

The sense of responsibility over ones space is awesome. We have been able to furnish and organise all of our contents exactly how we want, with no worry of what others will think because it doesn't matter! I feel as though a great sense of potential lies before us in this house, and of what the future holds in general.

Being back at work has proved to be mostly fine. I still wish I was spending more time at home working on my own projects but I shouldn't complain - I am thankful to have work and it's been good to see my co-workers again. Not much progress on my programming practice either but am hoping to work on this over the next few weeks.

T.
