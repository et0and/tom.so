## tom.so

This is my personal website, catalog of work and blog.

Built using Next.js with App Router, Typescript, and MDXRemote. It uses Keystatic as a headless CMS to manage content pages (in the form of MDX files), with support for custom components such as a are.na channel carousel, banner/announcement publishing, and YouTube integration via next/third-parties.

All content from [my previous website](https://github.com/et0and/portfolio-redux), which used 11ty, was migrated in June 2024 when I began this rewrite.

Feel free to fork and use this as you wish. I just ask that:

- you do not reuse, sell or distribute my content without my explicit permission
- realise that this is not a perfect project. It contains components that are very loosely typed, not entirely accessible/WCAG compliant, and needs work.

For a better example of a personal website that uses app router and Typescript, consider studying [Lee Robinson's website](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).
