The [Imaginary museum](https://are.na/tom/imaginary-museum) is an ongoing archive of reference material, designed for both online and offline (print) use.

Inspired by Gerhard Richter's _Atlas_ project, I wanted to create a research archive of different images and media using are.na.

This also exists at [atlas.tom.so](https://atlas.tom.so)
