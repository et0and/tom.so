summary: An early GAN experiment
---

Inspired by projects such as [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/), I wanted to experiment with StyleGAN to generate images. Using a dataset of houses, barns, warehouses and other buildings, I have been creating new "speculative" designs.

These images are a starting point. I am hoping to use them to create further works from this, as well as learn more about data-driven programming and the role of GANs in art making.

For the meantime generated buildings are being curated and saved [here on are.na.](https://www.are.na/tom-y/this-building-does-not-exist)
