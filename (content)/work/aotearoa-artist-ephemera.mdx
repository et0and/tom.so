Aotearoa artist ephemera was an online archive hosted on are.na of artist and gallery ephemera from Aotearoa New Zealand, dating from the early 1970s to the present day.

Most of these files are still under the respective copyright of the artist(s) and their representing galleries. As a result, this is simply an educational resource for the general public, but with the copyright held by their respective owners. I don't own anything here. Besides use for personal research this material is not intended to be used for profit.
