[Good sign-offs](https://work.tom.so/good-sign-offs) is a web experiment using the are.na API and Next.js. It pulls sign-offs from the Good Sign-Offs channel by [Meg Miller](https://megmiller.world) and renders a random block with each new load.

As the are.na API expands and matures over time, I look forward to making more experiments that deal with different connections made on the platform.
