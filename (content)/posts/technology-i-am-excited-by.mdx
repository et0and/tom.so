Happy new year!

It has been a lovely summer so far here in Auckland. There are some new emerging technologies that I have come across the past few weeks which excite me both as a teacher and researcher.

- Comma.ai
  [Comma.ai](https://comma.ai) is a fully FOSS Level 2 autonomous driving startup based in San Diego, founded by George Hotz (also known as geohot, a hacker and computer scientist whose work I have admired since he first jailbroke the iPhone in 2007). They are now selling a device, the Comma Two, which can be installed on most mainstream Toyotas, Hondas, Hyundais etc to enable full Level 2 autonomous driving. If Tesla and their Autopilot software is iOS, then Comma and their implementation (called "Openpilot") is Android. The next car I purchase will be one that I know is compatible with Comma, and I look forward to seeing how this software develops this year.

- DALL E by OpenAI
  This is a recent neural network developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that creates images from text captions, done in completely natural English. For example, typing the text prompt "an armchair in the shape of an avocado" will generate an image of a chair as such. It is an extension of their breakthrough autoregressive language model [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). As a visual art teacher, I have no idea what this potentially means for the creation of art and where the artist stands in a situation like this, but I am still looking forward to embracing this technology and seeing how it can help us develop long-term.

- Simula
  [Simula](https://github.com/SimulaVR/Simula) is a VR window manager that is built on top of the Godot Engine, programmed in Haskell and developed by George Singer. While I don't currently have a VR headset that I can use to test this, I think that the notion of spatial computing is an exciting one (especially in cases of limited physical space that might inhibit the use of multiple monitors).
