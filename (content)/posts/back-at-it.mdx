I went back to work this week, and it has been absolutely hectic so far.

Before Level 2 went into effect I guessed that people would react one of two ways:

One, that they would be afraid to venture out and continue to stay at home where possible, or

Two, that everyone would go back out en masse and rush to the mall, park, KFC and so on.

It seems the latter has turned out to be result of this shift. I wonder how long it will be until the lockdown will feel like a distant memory. At the same time, I canâ€™t help but feel we have so much more to learn from this and are still incredibly unprepared.
