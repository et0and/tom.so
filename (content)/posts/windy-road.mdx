Quite a bit had happened in the last few weeks but I haven't had the time to properly reflect on it all. Hopefully I can do this soon, but in the meantime there are a few things on the horizon:

- Merveilles is currently thinking about creating another jam where everyone puts together a drawing/graphic for a zine using PostScript

- starting to focus more on systems-level programming, especially with languages like C and Go to create my own little programs

- developing a greater understanding and practice of [UDL](http://www.cast.org/our-work/about-udl.html) with how I approach design

Looking forward to processing this all once everything settles down. Until then, I'll be [spinning in the air like an omelette](https://www.are.na/block/7993243)
