As it turns out, accessibility on the web means much more than simply adding alt text to things.

Today I completed the "Applied Accessibility" section on FreeCodeCamp. I had very little prior understanding of accessibility despite having an entire section on this website dedicated to it. While I personally think it is fairly legible and easy to navigate, there are many aspects of this site that are too abstracted for users of screen readers.

I had no idea that semantic HTML was a thing! Now upon having studied this it makes complete sense - looking through the source code of a webpage and seeing div tags everywhere makes difficult to read even from a development standpoint. It is logical for accessibility to extend to things like labels for forms, buttons, and even using CSS to display graphical information to screen-readers as a table.

This course has now made me seriously reconsider how I approach web development. I don't want to exclude users from navigating and using my site, especially if it's because I've cut corners in how I am writing my HTML + CSS. The WCAG is very comprehensive in this regard, and I think it is best for me to make this approach of making with accessibility in mind as standard practice from now on.
