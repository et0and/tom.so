Yesterday evening the government announced a new lockdown for those living in Auckland. We will be in Level 3 for at least the next seven days, during which time I will be teaching remotely yet again.

Slowly as we have more and more situations such as this I am getting used to virtual learning. It is still greatly challenging - especially in the case of teaching kids who have inconsistent internet connections and/or unreliable technology. My own connection at home is flaky, with Google Meets often dropping mid-call or uploads being interrupted.

Despite the fact that we have been doing this for close to a year now, I think that we as educators still have much to learn. The technology hasn't gotten that much better over this time, and I am still not sure about the strategies many of us are taking to ensure a productive remote learning environment.

I am not sure what the answer is. I don't know if anyone does. If anything, I think this pandemic continues to show us how ill-prepared many of us are. A vaccine is thankfully around the corner, but what will the next pandemic make of us?
